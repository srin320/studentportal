1. Paste the project file in the root folder of the local server.
2. Open phpmyadmin, create a database named "group15" and import the "group15.sql" file in that database from the project folder.
3. Now you can start your server and open the project by the URL - http://localserver/studentportal/home.php


// Username and Password for the database should be "root" & "root"............


Thank you!
